								<p class="mt-2.1 text-md text-gray-700 leading-normal custom-coverletter">Dear Dr. James Taylor,</p>
								<p class="mt-2.1 text-md text-gray-700 leading-relaxed custom-coverletter">This letter is addressed to you regarding my interest in the NDRC research internship opportunity. My name is Carter Brehm, and I am a freshman at the University of Nebraska Omaha. I was recently introduced to the position by my Scott Scholars program director, Harnoor Singh. I am very interested in this opportunity because I am looking for a challenging and competitive position in the field of cybersecurity and defense, specifically relating to networking. I am also looking for an internship to broaden my skillset in computer science.</p>
								<p class="mt-2.1 text-md text-gray-700 leading-relaxed custom-coverletter">My ability to problem solve in new situations makes me a great fit for the position. In 2019, I worked on a small team for eight weeks that employed industry-standard problem solving and development cycle strategies. In this short period of time, we were able to quickly begin working on the project that we had originally known nothing about, by breaking the task down and working through portions of it at a time, relying on each other for guidance. This problem solving skillset has also benefited me working on other projects. On multiple occasions, I have worked with small businesses as well as large corporations on finding technology solutions to suit their needs.</p>
								<p class="mt-2.1 text-md text-gray-700 leading-relaxed custom-coverletter">Additionally, I am able to pick up new skills and technology very quickly. Most of my experience in networking and communications is self-taught, mostly because I have tremendous interest towards the field and greatly enjoy learning more about it. For example, I have become particularly familiar with the structure of IPv4 and IPv6 networks by actively running and managing several of them, and use software such as Wireshark and NMAP to constantly tinker and learn more about the way they function. I am also familiar with Wireguard and Shadowsocks VPN protocols to secure my internet activity. I regularly work with the API on consumer RF blasters to control and automate several remote-control devices around my home.</p>
								<p class="mt-2.1 text-md text-gray-700 leading-relaxed custom-coverletter">Throughout my career I have also become considerably experienced at the problem solving and development strategies employed in the industry. I regularly use Git for my personal projects as well as when collaborating, and extensively document issues and pull requests on the specific platform used. I have also used a variety of continuous integration tools such as Jenkins and Github Actions with the software. Currently, I am working on a standards-compliant API to build on top of a prior project to allow for the usage of a mobile app. I also maintain several cloud servers ranging from public services to private network routing.</p>
								<p class="mt-2.1 text-md text-gray-700 leading-relaxed custom-coverletter">I am confident that my experience and skills would allow me to be successful in supporting your objectives, as well as supporting my growth as a technologist. I would greatly appreciate the chance to speak with you about my ability to fill this position. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to discussing this opportunity with you.</p>
								<p class="mt-2.1 text-md text-gray-700 leading-normal">Sincerely,</p>
								<p class="mt-2.1 text-md text-gray-700 leading-normal custom-coverletter">Carter Brehm</p>
