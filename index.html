After becoming familiar with a traditional IT toolset including Git and Trello, we began conducting research on the applicable topics in order to further our understanding before ideating. Then, we came up with a development plan including a MVP and stretch goals. Using Unity and C#, we were able to ship a working Android app collaboratively within the time constraints. A video demo of the game is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_xSkuNUtV5oWnC-4MXaoGeEbo0yqmCmC/view?usp=sharing">here</a> and midpoint and final presentations created during the creation of the app, intended to highlight portions of the development process, are available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pypofln5uT3bKGfeSDnQDpTioJtW5oaQ/view?usp=sharing">here</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p5RjmBbowJ-dPgAl0LsX-m7zVzXP6Kafp0bTPVW4zco/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

Influence from the people around me naturally guided this hunger for knowledge toward the world of computers, of which the depth of information seemed nearly endless. I've designed websites, developed apps, created solutions, all in the quest for knowledge. </p>

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">August 23rd, 2021</div>
                            <p><strong>&quot;It&#39;s one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he&#39;s leading to realize whatever he&#39;s dreaming.&quot;</strong></p>
                            <p>When Benjamin was done playing his piece of Chopin, he specifically mentioned how &quot;If their eyes are shining, you know you&#39;re doing it.&quot; But, what is <em>it</em> that he&#39;s referring to? Through the medium of classical music, Benjamin is showing the audience what it means to be a good leader. The audience&#39;s eyes are &quot;shining&quot; not because he is a leader in the technical sense of the word (he isn&#39;t leading the audience through a project, or organizing a committee, or anything else that comes to mind when one thinks of the word leader), but because he is capturing the basic essense of what a leader is meant for: to <strong>inspire, rally, and guide people towards a goal or vision</strong>. </p>
                            <p>Inspiration, and the ability to rally people behind a common goal, is what makes a leader. Sure, administrative tasks may be important to a team, but anyone can do those things. That&#39;s just referred to as being responsible toward a client or deadline (in the case of a project team). Without a central drive to push the team forward, nothing will get done. I saw a real example of this during my summer internship. Jackson, our team lead, did a lot of interfacing with the client and administration of the project, but the team hinged on our <strong>own individual leaderships</strong> of our ideas and prototypes to push forward and come out with a final product.</p>
                            <p>A <strong>responsible leader</strong> combines the best of both worlds. They have that drive that pushes the team forward, but also have the technical and administrative skills to back them up. They also may use others&#39; skills and strengths for their maximum benefit, and know when to call on those skills to manage the group&#39;s workload.</p>

                            <h3 class="mb-0">Empathy</h3>
                            <div class="subheading mb-3">June 8th, 2021</div>
                            <p>In my opinion, empathy is absolutely crucial in all steps and aspects of the design-thinking process. Gathering data about the situation before beginning to brainstorm, working with peers to brainstorm solutions, delegating tasks during development, and even collecting feedback from observers on your design and development process, all depend on using empathy to attempt to understand others.</p>
                            <p>I&#39;ve always valued empathy the most in the initial stages of design: trying to fully understand the problem. It&#39;s easy--whether as a student working on a project, a developer working for a client, or just a person helping out--to assume that because it doesn&#39;t <em>seem</em> like an issue , it doesn&#39;t need to be fixed. This is rarely the case, because only if a problem existed would someone be needing help. For example, as someone who knows my way around a computer, I deal with trivial problems often, such as when a user is frustrated that their computer doesn&#39;t always log into their email automatically, only sometimes. At first, this may seem like a non-issue: just enter your username and password when it doesn&#39;t log you in. However, maybe the user has trouble remembering their password, and has to reset it almost every time. Now, it&#39;s an issue.</p>
                            <p>Once you&#39;ve identified the problem, it&#39;s just as important to approach the problem from the perspective you&#39;ve already established (from the user&#39;s perspective, not yours). Trying to come up with a solution from your perspective may leave the user worse-off than before. Continuing with my previous analogy, suppose I ask the user to simply create a secure vault on their computer to store all their passwords, which is encrypted with a passphrase that they set. It&#39;s perfect, right? Fixes the issue of not remembering the email password, and it keeps security tight. That&#39;s what I would do. But, now the user has to remember their new passphrase, and how to use the password manager, and how to fix the vault if it breaks. That&#39;s because <em>I&#39;ve</em> created the solution for <em>me</em>, not for the <em>user</em>. Maybe the user doesn&#39;t need encrypted passwords. Maybe they just need a more memorable password (instead of the default one), and to be taught how to use the notes app on their phone to keep it safe. Grandma Barb doesn&#39;t need 256-bit AES encryption, she needs a pad of paper in a drawer. </p>
                            <p>As I stated before, empathy is also important <em>during</em> the designing process, within a team. Working together on a project (especially for an extended period of time) is an easy way to brew conflict between members, and it&#39;s important to monitor for these things so that they don&#39;t affect the final product. The easiest way to do that is to forget about oneself when working as a team. I could get angry that my draft wasn&#39;t the one picked for the next stage of design, or I could just take the best parts of my draft and apply them to be used on our final product, if we need to make it better. I could complain that another member on the team isn&#39;t doing as much work, or I could simply complete my portion of the job and just ask for help if I need it. </p>
                            <p>I don&#39;t typically take a leadership position unless it&#39;s specifically requested of me. I like having a direction, and exploring the extent of that direction and contributing my findings to my team or team leader. In my opinion, the less voices there are trying to forcefully take charge of the situation, or steer the group in a specific direction, the less chance of conflict to form. I will however, back up my positions and present my findings to the group if I do think that we need to change our development or direction.</p>

                            <h3 class="mb-0">Empathy Interview</h3>
                            <div class="subheading mb-3">June 17th, 2021</div>
                            <p>A couple days ago, I was able to learn about the process of conducting an empathy interview with another person, and was able to try one for the first time. </p>
                            <p>Before learning what an empathy interview was according to the design thinking process, I had my assumptions. Talk to the end-user, get their opinions, find the problem that needed to be fixed. That&#39;s how my process had worked in the past, so that&#39;s what I had assumed this interview would be like. As the process was demonstrated, I realized that it wasn&#39;t so much asking about the end-users opinions, but rather <strong>asking directly about the experience itself, so that the problem can be interpreted more accurately.</strong> Empathizing with the user is important, but asking the user <em>directly</em> what is wrong can sometimes be a dead-end. They may say that they need help finding a chicken for their cake, but what they really need is an egg. That&#39;s why an empathy interview goes beyond surface-level details and instead tries to pick at the emotions felt by the people affected. </p>
                            <p>This was made evident by the types of questions that were asked during a good empathy interview. Asking about an experience &quot;in general&quot; may sound like a good judgement to make, given that you want a summary of all the information the user has to offer. However, this won&#39;t get you any emotion or personal detail to the story, only those surface-level details that the end-user feels are important. This is why it&#39;s also important to maintain control of the interview, despite the urge to let the user ramble on about their experience. Sometimes, the user may march down memory lane about a different problem, something that&#39;s outside of your current scope, or just something that&#39;s not as important as the main storyline. You can ask grounding questions to prod them back on track <em>(&quot;How did that make you feel?&quot;)</em> or even directly tell them to talk about a specific topic. </p>
                            <p>During my practice interview, I made sure to employ as many of the techniques during the example interview I had seen. I started by asking about my partner&#39;s most memorable experience in school during COVID. Quickly, he began to ramble about the events of a traditional day that he remembered, so I made sure to clarify, &quot;how did you feel starting today?&quot; Using this, I got my baseline metric and was able to put all of the other events of the day into scale. I then let him resume, making sure to watch body language and other details like tone and speed to determine how he was feeling at this point of the day. I noticed he would speed up and explain extensively certain high points of his day, but he would brush over lower points, so I began asking him specifically, &quot;what specifically made you feel this way?&quot; Other times he would mention expositional info, such as something from a previous day or an existing behavior he already had, and I made sure to note these down on my empathy probe. With each event I was tracking, I tried to find out three things:</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>How did he feel during that moment?</li>
                            <li>What stimuli caused him to feel that way?</li>
                            <li>Why does he think it caused him to feel that way?</li>
                            
                            </ul>
                            <p>This led me to create an extensive map, and by the time he was done I had completed my entire sheet. </p>
                            <p>I do believe that the empathy probe is a very powerful tool for understanding the plights of others, and its profound effect of giving someone a metaphorical rat in someone else&#39;s race can be very powerful when it comes to ideating and coming up with solutions.. And, while its original intention is to solve a problem using the design thinking process, most of the principles could also be applied to normal conversation. Sometimes it&#39;s better to understand how a person is feeling directly, rather than just what is making them feel that way.</p>
